                        <h3>Problem</h3>
                        <p>
                            ABC Product had outdated and unappealing packaging that failed to capture the attention of
                            potential customers. The packaging did not align with the product's premium quality or
                            convey its unique features.

                            ABC Product needed packaging that reflected its premium quality, communicated the product's
                            benefits, and stood out on shelves to capture customers' attention.

                            the target audience and packaging trends in the industry. They created a sleek and
                            minimalist packaging design that showcased the product's quality, incorporated engaging
